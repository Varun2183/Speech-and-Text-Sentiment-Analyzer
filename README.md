**Speech and Text Sentiment Analyzer**

A Python-based tool for performing sentiment analysis on both spoken and typed input. This project leverages VADER sentiment analysis, Google Speech Recognition, and Matplotlib for visualizing sentiment scores.

**Features :**

Speech Recognition: Convert spoken words to text using Google Speech Recognition.
Text Analysis: Analyze typed sentences for sentiment.
Sentiment Analysis: Use VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to calculate sentiment scores (Positive, Negative, Neutral, and Compound).
Visualization: Display results in a bar graph.
CSV Storage: Automatically saves unique sentiment analysis results to a CSV file to avoid duplicates.

**Requirements:**

tkinter: For the graphical user interface.
speech_recognition: To convert spoken words into text.
vaderSentiment: For sentiment analysis.
pandas: To handle CSV file operations.
matplotlib: To visualize sentiment analysis results.

**Future Enhancements :**

**1.** Add options for custom models or additional sentiment analysis libraries.
**2.** Provide support for different languages using other speech recognition services.
**3.** Enhance the visualization with more interactive graphs.
